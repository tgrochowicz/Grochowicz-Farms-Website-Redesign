              According to the United States Department of Agriculture, natural meat is “minimally processed and contains no artificial ingredients.” At Grochowicz Farms we go one step further.
          </p>
          <p>
              We provide the highest quality meat products by raising our animals without the use of growth hormones or the use of antibiotics. Our cattle are raised on pasture and eat grasses. Grains are slowly introduced into the diet in a controlled amount, along with the grasses. By controlling the amount of grain, the animals do not become sick or develop digestion problems that solely grain-fed cattle can encounter. They are not forced to eat the grain as they are in factory farms or feedlots. Strictly grass fed cattle are much less flavorful. We have developed a supplemental grain-based feeding formula to deliver a well-marbled product that has a superior taste. Rest assured, all of the grain that we feed our animals is grown and harvested right here on our family farm. We take pride in raising our animals in a humane and ecologically sustainable manner.
          </p>
          <p>
              Our meat is processed with quality control procedures at a USDA inspected facility. The beef is dry-aged a minimum of 14 days before it is cut, vacuum sealed and flash frozen to preserve its perfection. Our All Natural Beef is rated PRIME by the USDA Inspectors. Our ground beef is 92% lean and available in one pound packages or preformed patties. You can also find our own All Beef Franks 8 to a pack. Stop in our farm market where we sell only our own farm raised meats. We have several cuts available for purchase during our regular business hours. Enjoy our beef which is sold by the piece or by value priced packages.Ground Beef and the Ground Sirloin Patties are available at a discount when purchasing a large quantity.
          </p>
          <p>
              We also have our own Country Smoked Bacon available. Large quantities require advance notice.
